# Budget Tracker

[Live Site](https://morning-ocean-20973.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
This project was meant to solidify Progressive Web App functionality, Offline functionality using IndexedDB, and Caching/re-routing web requests using Service Workers.

I started with existing code, then added the various pieces like above to achieve the end functionality.

## Usage
To use the site, enter a description in the "Name of Transaction" field, and then a transaction amount in the "Transaction amount" field. Make sure the amount is always positive in the field.

If it's a deposit, click "Add Funds", if it's an expense, click "Subtract Funds".
